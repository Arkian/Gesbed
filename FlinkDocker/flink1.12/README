Usage:

# Check whether 'flink' image is loaded 
$docker images

# If 'flink' image is not present 
$tar -zxvf flink-1.12.0.tgz
$./build.sh

# Now 'flink' image is loaded to the master node. The same can be checked using the following command:
$docker images


# To copy the flink image to the Workers node, execute either 
$./CopyImageToWorkers.sh

# or, if the previous command did not work
$./CopyFlinkImageToWorkers.sh
