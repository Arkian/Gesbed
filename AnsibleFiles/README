Usage:
-First update the host names and IPs in both /etc/hosts and /etc/ansible/hosts:
*You can do it manualy or can modify the "bootstrap.yml" and then run it with ansible ($ansible-playbook bootstrap.yml)

-Then run the following command (to restart):
 $./restartAllNodes.sh (you already have it in HOME of pc0, but need to update it if you have changed the host names)

-Then run the following commands to update the keys.
$sh genKeys.sh
$ssh pc0
$exit

-Then to test ansible: 
$ansible all -m ping

-Then run the following command to set IPtables: (This needs to be set based on the hosts names)
$./setupIptablesKubernetes.sh

-Then run the following to install docker+K8s on nodes:
$ansible-playbook install_docker_k8s.yml 

-To check if all nodes are connected correctly: 
$kubectl get nodes

- If you can not see the nodes, run $./restartAllNodes.sh and then run $./setupIptablesKubernetes.sh again

-Another point: For turnning off the cluster run:
$./picoStopAll.sh and then switch off the cluster (more safe ;-))
